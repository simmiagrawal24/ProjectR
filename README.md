# ProjectR
 This is basically a website that we have made to connect the professors looking to assign projects to students, it also helps the students looking for projects. 
 In this website a student can login through their institute Email Id . The default login is User ID - 3 and password- abc. 
 The students are required to create their profile and start searching for projects. This will enable the students to find all sorts of projects be it coding and especially non-   coding projects.
 A student can also create their own projects and find like minded individuals who can collaborate on it with him. They can also track progress and search progress according to fields they wish to work in. 
 The professors can view student profiles which can help them assign a project to a particular student.
 As we need an extensive database to make this website fully functional and properly scale it, we have just created a sample project search - "Biosciences" to showcase the functionalities of the website.
