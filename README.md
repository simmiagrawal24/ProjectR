# ProjectR
 This is basically a website that we have made to connect the professors looking to assign projects to students and students looking for projects. In this website a student can login through their institute Email Id . The default login is User ID - 3 and password- abc. The student can  create their profile and start looking for projects. A student can also create their own projects and find like minded individuals who can collaborate on it with him. They can also track progress and search progress according to fields they wish to work in. The professors can view student profiles which can help them assign a project to a particular student.
